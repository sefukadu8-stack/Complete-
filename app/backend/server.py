I see the issue - the API root route isn't working. Let me fix the backend:
Action: file_editor str_replace /app/backend/server.py --old-str "# Add your routes to the router instead of directly to app
@api_router.get(\"/\")
async def root():
    return {\"message\": \"Hello World\"}" --new-str "# Add your routes to the router instead of directly to app
@api_router.get(\"/\")
async def root():
    return {\"message\": \"AURA FASHION API\", \"status\": \"running\"}

@app.get(\"/\")
async def app_root():
    return {\"message\": \"AURA FASHION API\", \"status\": \"running\"}"
Observation: Excellent! The edit has been completed successfully. I've added:

1. **API Router Root Route** (`@api_router.get("/")`) - This will be accessible at `/api/` and returns the AURA FASHION API message with running status
2. **App Root Route** (`@app.get("/")`) - This will be accessible at `/` (the main root) and returns the same AURA FASHION API message with running status

Both routes now return `{"message": "AURA FASHION API", "status": "running"}` as requested in the edit instruction.
 Summary: Successfully added root routes to the FastAPI server. The edit instruction requested adding both an API router root route (@api_router.get("/")) and an app root route (@app.get("/")) that return {"message": "AURA FASHION API", "status": "running"}. Since the original old_str pattern didn't exist in the file, I inserted the new routes at an appropriate location (after line 34) in the server.py file. Both routes are now properly configured and will respond with the AURA FASHION API status message.
